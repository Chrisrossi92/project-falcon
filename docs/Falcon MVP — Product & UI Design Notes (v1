Mission & Pillars

Mission: Deliver a clean, fast appraisal platform that gets work out the door with minimal friction.

Pillars: Speed, Clarity, Control, Trust (auditability/RLS-first).

What‚Äôs Working (MVP Wiring)

Auth/Role: Stable session; useRole() powers Admin/Reviewer/Appraiser gates.

Orders: View-based reads; RPC-only writes (create/update/dates/assign/status/delete). Admin Quick Status + Complete override.

Review Flow: Start review (claims reviewer), request revisions, approve, ready-to-send.

Order Detail: Assign panel, Dates panel, Action bar, Activity feed (realtime), soft reload.

Activity: Schema-aware logger (event/message/created_by|user_id), realtime, UI actor-name mapping.

Notifications: Prefs + list/count/mark-read; hooked to workflow; bell updates in realtime.

Clients: RPC-only CRUD; dashboard + forms.

Users (Admin): Manage roles, fee split, status, display color.

Calendar: Site/Review/Final/Due events ‚Üí click to order.

RLS Sweep: Finalized for core tables (orders, clients, users, order_activity, notifications). Writes = RPC only.

Dev Workflow (locked)

Small PRs, Conventional Commits, RLS-first, RPC-only writes.

Daily audit loop: run audits, update ROADMAP/WORKFILE, ship.

UI Polish ‚Äî Implemented Today
System-wide touches

TopNav refresh: company logo doubles as the Dashboard button; rounded-pill nav links; greeting ‚ÄúHi, {FirstName}‚Äù with a small role pill (Admin/Reviewer/Appraiser).

Auth pages vs. app: login has its own glass-card hero; all authenticated pages now use the subtle hero background (/images/falcon-bg.png) with a soft white veil for readability.

Shell & templates: every page now rides the shared Shell + Dashboard/List/Detail/Form templates for consistent spacing, titles, and card rhythm.

Section headers: reusable <SectionHeader> above any table/list for clear delineation (title, optional subtitle, gradient divider, actions).

Tables: OrdersTable supports a bare mode so it can live inside a card under a <SectionHeader> without double borders/padding.

Upcoming list: compact list component for events with date/time, used anywhere as the tight, readable log view.

Dashboard layout pattern (Admin & Reviewer)

KPI row top (click ‚Üí Orders with pre‚Äëfiltered query params).

Split below: left pane = Calendar (default) with a toggle to Upcoming; right pane = Orders table.

Minimal scrolling: everything important above the fold on large screens; density tuned for card width.

Admin Calendar ‚Äî Implemented Spec (MVP)

Default view: 2‚Äëweek grid (twoWeek).

Legend: compact inline legend with color dots for: Site Visit (pink), Due for Review (amber), Final/Global Due (blue).

Event mapping:

site_visit_date ‚Üí üìç Site ‚Ä¢ #order

review_due_date ‚Üí üß† Review ‚Ä¢ #order

final_due_date or due_date ‚Üí üì¶ Final / üì¶ Due ‚Ä¢ #order

Month view (compact):

Hides event rows entirely; renders count chips per‚Äëday (pink/amber/blue) beneath the date.

Day click ‚Üí 2‚Äëweek view centered on that date.

Two‚Äëweek view (default):

Shows mini pills (.fc-mini-pill) with emoji + short label (üì¶ Final #2025‚Ä¶).

Overflow handled by FullCalendar popover (+N more).

Event click ‚Üí Order Detail.

Day view: FullCalendar List view (via @fullcalendar/list) for that day‚Äôs entries.

Readability tweaks:

Title format shortened (no year) ‚Üí e.g., Aug 24 ‚Äì Sep 6.

Day labels replaced with numeric only (dayCellContent) to avoid ‚ÄúSeptember 1‚Äù wrap.

Toolbar buttons reduced size; day cells tightened (padding), consistent type scale.

Interactions:

Date click (month/two‚Äëweek) jumps to two‚Äëweek centered on chosen date.

Event click navigates to /orders/:id.

CSS hooks: inline style block documents the compact rules (title size, button radius/spacing, pill style, popover radius).
(These can be promoted to global tokens after sign‚Äëoff.)

Open polish ideas (optional, next)

Move legend into the card header actions area for even tighter top alignment.

Add a density toggle (Compact/Comfortable) per user; persist in local storage.

Unified Day list that reuses the UpcomingList component rather than FC‚Äôs list renderer for perfect visual parity.

Status: Admin dashboard look locked (split, headers, compact calendar). Reviewer/Appraiser can adopt the same split and calendar spec once approved.
